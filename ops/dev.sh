#
# Why this exists: the API and the console were started separately and lived for
# days, so a process could outlive the .env that configured it — that is exactly
# how the console ended up talking to a Grafana MCP server the .env had already
# moved away from. Here both are children of this script, `--reload` picks up
# backend edits, and the trap kills the whole process group on Ctrl-C so nothing
# is left running with stale configuration.
